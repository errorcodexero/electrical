This is the blinky light code for the 2018 FRC robot

The robot sends details about its status over I2C to the Arduino which then reads and saves those values. 

Using time and the robot status, the blinky lights are set.

To add a new blinky light mode:
- Add a new child class of Light_mode_base
- Define its set_leds and print methods
- Add a value to the Mode enum in the main Lights class, then add corresponding mode selection logic and assignment of the light mode in the switch based off that enum value
